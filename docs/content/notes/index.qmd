## Introduction

There isn't a lot of material on the web devoted to computational work in [GF(2)]. \
We add some here:

Paper  | Topic
------ | -----------
[Working in GF(2)](/content/notes/gf2.qmd)           | Some notes about the vagaries of working in $\FF$.
[Library Design Notes](/content/notes/design.qmd)    | Notes about the overall design of the `bit` library.
[Danilevsky's Method](/content/notes/danilevsky.qmd) | An algorithm to compute the characteristic polynomial of a square matrix --- the algorithm isn't well known, so we review it here.
[Polynomial Reduction](/content/notes/reduction.qmd) | An algorithm to compute $x^N$ mod $P(x)$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial over $\FF$ and $N$ is potentially a huge integer.
