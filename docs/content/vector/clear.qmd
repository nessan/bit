title: "`bit::vector` --- Clear"
---

{{< include /content/_common.qmd >}}

Clears out the contents of a bit-vector:
```cpp
constexpr bit::vector &clear();
```
The bit-vector's `size()` becomes 0, but its capacity is _not_ changed.
This method returns a reference to `*this` so it can be chained with other calls.

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <bit/bit.h>
int main()
{
    auto v = bit::vector<>::ones(8);
    std::cout << "v: " << v << '\n';
    v.clear();
    std::cout << "v: " << v << '\n';
}
```

[Output]{.bt}
```bash
v: [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
v: []
```
