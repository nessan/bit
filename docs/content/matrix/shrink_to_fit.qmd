title: "`bit::matrix` --- Minimize the Space Used"
---

{{< include /content/_common.qmd >}}

Potentially change the _capacity_  of a bit-matrix.

```cpp
constexpr bit::matrix &shrink_to_fit();          // <1>
```
1. This is a request to minimize the unused/excess [`matrix::row_capacity`] and [`matrix::col_capacity`] .
May do nothing.

The method returns `*this`, so you can chain it with other calls.

The method will _not_ change the dimensions of a bit-matrix (so `rows()`, `cols()`, and `size()` remain unchanged).
No elements are added or deleted.

::: {.callout-warning}
# References may get lost
If the capacity does change, all the old _values_ are unaltered, but be aware that any pre-existing element references are invalidated.
