title: "`bit::polynomial` --- Coefficient Counts"
---

{{< include /content/_common.qmd >}}

We have methods to count the number of ones and zeros in the vector of polynomial coefficients.
```cpp
constexpr std::size_t count0() const;     // <1>
constexpr std::size_t count1() const;     // <2>
```
1. Returns the number of zero coefficients in the polynomial.
2. Returns the number of one coefficients in the polynomial.
