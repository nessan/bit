{{< include /content/_common.qmd >}}

## Introduction

A `bit::polynomial` represents a polynomial over [GF(2)] (also known as $\FF$), the simplest [Galois Field] that has just two elements 0 & 1, where arithmetic is mod 2.

If $p(x)$ is the bit-polynomial:
$$
p(x) = p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2 + \cdots + p_{n-1} x^{n-1},
$$
then the argument $x$ and the polynomial coefficients $p_0, p_1, \ldots$ are all elements of $\FF$.

The `bit::polynomial` class holds the polynomial coefficients in a [`bit::vector`].
Instance methods forward much of their work to that data member.
However, some bit-polynomial methods need a separate implementation.
For example, bit-vector addition only makes sense for two equal-sized bit-vectors, but of course, we have to be able to add two polynomials of different degrees.

# Polynomial size and degree
The *size* of a bit-polynomial is the number of its coefficients.
The *degree* of a bit-polynomial is the index of the highest non-trivial power in the polynomial.
*Monic* polynomials are nonzero and have no trailing zero coefficients.

Operations on and between polynomials generally can ignore trailing zero coefficients.
This can be an important efficiency consideration in some cases.

Algorithms and methods in the `bit::polynomial` class allow for this and internally work efficiently even if the polynomials are not monic.
They do that by reimplementing some of the core `bit::vector` functionality to only consider underlying storage blocks up to and including the one containing the highest non-trivial power.

We also note that polynomial methods usually need to treat the zero-polynomial as a *special*, generally trivial, edge case.

## Declaration

Like everything in the library, this class is in the `bit` namespace and is defined in the header `<bit/polynomial.h>` as follows:
``` cpp
namespace bit {
  template<std::unsigned_integral Block = std::uint64_t,
           Allocator = std::allocator<Block>>
  class polynomial;
}
```
The `bit::polynomial` class holds the polynomial coefficients in a [`bit::vector`] data member that uses the two template parameters.

The two template parameters add some visual clutter, but they both have reasonable defaults and disappear entirely in most uses.
For example, your code might have a simple line like:
``` cpp
bit::polynomial p{32};
```
This code creates a polynomial with 32 coefficients set to 0 by default.

### Template Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
`Block` = `std::uint64_t`              | The polynomial coefficients are packed into blocks of some [`std::unsigned_integral`] type. The default size is 64 bits.
`Allocator` = `std::allocator<Block>`  | The default `Allocator` should be just fine for most purposes, but you can use your custom type to handle all memory allocation/destruction for blocks.
: {.bordered .hover .responsive}

The default `Block` is 64-bits, the *native* size for many modern CPUs.

Of course, if you need to use many smaller degree bit-polynomials and have concerns about conserving space, you might use a different `Block`.
Perhaps if the bit-polynomials all have degrees that fit in 8 bits, you might have code along the lines:

``` cpp
using poly_type= bit::polynomial<uint8_t>;
poly_type p = ...
```

::: callout-warning
# Use a single `Block` type throughout your code!
In theory, there is no reason that one couldn't intermingle operations between, say, a `bit::polynomial<std::uint32_t>` and a `bit::polynomial<std::uint64_t>`, but doing so efficiently significantly increases code complexity, and the library doesn't support this.
