title: "`bit::polynomial` --- Is the Polynomial Special?"
---

{{< include /content/_common.qmd >}}

We have methods to query if this polynomial is "special" in some way.
```cpp
constexpr bool zero()       const;      // <1>
constexpr bool nonzero()    const;      // <2>
constexpr bool one()        const;      // <3>
constexpr bool constant()   const;      // <4>
```
1. Returns `true` if this is any form of the zero polynomial.
2. Returns `true` as long as this is not the zero polynomial.
3. Returns `true` if this is the polynomial $p(x) = 1$.
4. Returns `true` if this is either the zero or the one polynomial.

# The zero polynomial
The zero polynomial might have no coefficients so `size() == 0`, or it might have lots of zero coefficients and a `size() > 0`.
In either case, the degree will be the special "not a degree" constant `polynomial::ndeg`.

Methods usually need to treat the zero-polynomial as a *special*, generally trivial, edge case.
