title: "`bit::solve` --- Solver"
---

We supply a standalone non-member function that attempts to solve the system of linear equations $A \cdot x = b$ over {f2}.

```cpp
std::optional<bit::vector>
bit::solve(const bit::matrix &A, const bit::vector &b)  // <1>
```
1. `A` must be square, and `b` must be the same size as the number of rows in `A`.

The [std::optional] return value can be safely dereferenced as a bit-vector if everything goes well.
That bit-vector will be a solution $x$ to the system $A \cdot x = b$.
The solution may or may not be unique.

If there is a problem, the return value will be a {std.nullopt}.
This happens if the system of equations has no solution.
It will also be the case if `A` is not square or if the size of `b` is not the same as the number of rows in `A`.

NOTE: The idea is to get _one_ solution for a system of equations with the least possible fuss. +
Over {f2}, any free variable can take on one of the values 0 and 1.
Hence, if the system is consistent and has $f$ free variables, it will have $2^f$ possible solutions.
So, a consistent system will have a unique solution only if $A$ has full-rank.
The {gauss.operator(i)} method iterates through potentially non-unique solutions if that is required.

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <bit/bit.h>
int
main()
{
    std::size_t m = 12;

    auto A = bit::matrix<>::random(m);
    auto b = bit::vector<>::random(m);
    auto x = bit::solve(A, b);

    if(x) {
        // Check that x is indeed a solution by computing A.x and comparing that to b
        auto Ax = bit::dot(A, *x);
        std::cout << "bit::matrix A, solution vector x, product A.x, and right hand side b\n";
        bit::print(A, *x, Ax, b);
        std::cout << "So A.x == b? " << (Ax == b ? "YES" : "NO") << '\n';
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "System A.x = b has NO solutions for A and b as follows\n";
        bit::print(A, b);
    }
}
```

[Output for a consistent system (details depend on the values of the random inputs)]{.bt}
