title: "`bit::polynomial` --- Sub-polynomials"
---

We have a method that creates a new distinct polynomial by copying coefficients from this one.
```cpp
constexpr polynomial sub(std::size_t n) const;
```
Here `n` is the number of *coefficients* to copy.

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <bit/bit.h>
int main()
{
    bit::polynomial p{11};
    p.set();
    auto q = p.sub(7);
    std::cout << std::format("p         = {}\n", p);
    std::cout << std::format("q         = {}\n", q);
    std::cout << std::format("q.clear() = {}\n", q.clear());
    std::cout << std::format("p         = {}\n", p);
}
```

[Output]{.bt}
```bash
p         = 1 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10
q         = 1 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6
q.clear() = 0
p         = 1 + x^1 + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 + x^8 + x^9 + x^10
```

So even though we cleared out `q` the original polynomial `p` is not affected.
