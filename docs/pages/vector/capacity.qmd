title: "`bit::vector` --- Storage Capacity"
---

How many elements can a bit-vector store in its current state?

```cpp
constexpr std::size_t capacity() const;   // <1>
constexpr std::size_t unused() const;     // <2>
```
1. Returns the number of elements the bit-vector can store in its current state.
2. Returns the spare capacity in the bit-vector in its current state, i.e., `capacity() - size()`.

We may not be using all the storage for some bit-vectors.
For example, if we construct a small `bit::vector` with, say, eight elements and use the default `Block` of `uint64_t`, we will have at least a single storage block, so a capacity of 64.
Thus, there are 56 spare slots --- we can append 56 more elements to the vector before allocating more storage.

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <bit/bit.h>
int main()
{
    auto v = bit::vector<>::checker_board(8);
    std::cout << "bit::vector "     << v            << ": ";
    std::cout << "size "            << v.size()     << ", ";
    std::cout << "capacity "        << v.capacity() << ", ";
    std::cout << "unused capacity " << v.unused()   << ".\n";
}
```

[Output]{.bt}
```bash
bit::vector [0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1]: size 8, capacity 64, unused capacity 56
```
