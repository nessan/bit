title: "`bit::vector` --- Stream Operators"
---

Methods to insert or extract a bit-vector from a stream.

```cpp
template<std::unsigned_integral Block, typename Alloc>
std::ostream &
operator<<(std::ostream &s, const bit::vector<Block, Alloc> &rhs);   // <1>

template<std::unsigned_integral Block, typename Alloc>
std::istream &
operator>>(std::istream &s, bit::vector<Block, Alloc> &rhs);         // <2>
```
1. Writes a binary string representation of a bit-vector to an output stream.
2. Fill a bit-vector by reading bits encoded as a binary or hex string from a stream.

The input stream operator will throw a `std::invalid_argument` exception on parse failures.

::: {.callout-note}
# Vector-ordering
Strings are written or read in _vector-order_ where the least significant element is on the _left_, so as v~0~v~1~v~2~...

## Valid Strings

[Example]{.bt}
```cpp
#include <bit/bit.h>
int main()
{
    // Read from a stream until we have a parse error ...
    while (true) {
        bit::vector<> v;
        std::cout << "bit::vector? ";
        try {
            std::cin >> v;
            std::cout << "Parsed as " << v << std::endl;
        }
        catch (...) {
            std::cout << "Couldn't parse that input as a bit::vector! Quitting ..." << std::endl;
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Input and Output:
```bash
bit::vector? 111
Parsed as [1 1 1]
bit::vector? 0b111
Parsed as [1 1 1]
bit::vector? 0x111
Parsed as [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
bit::vector? 0x111_8
Parsed as [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0]
bit::vector? 0x111_4
Parsed as [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0]
bit::vector? 0x111_2
Parsed as [1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1]
bit::vector? q
Couldn't parse that input as a bit::vector! Quitting ...
```
